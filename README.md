# Password-Generator


# Project Description 

In the 3rd challenge of the bootcamp, I set out to make a random password generator. The password generator should give a couple of prompts when the generate password button is clicked. After the password criteria is set, a random password should appear in a window alert.  

# Installation 

To view the project, clone the git repository using VS Code. this will allow you to vie the index.html file ass well as the css style file and javascript file. The website can be view by right clicking in the index.html file and opening via web browser.
